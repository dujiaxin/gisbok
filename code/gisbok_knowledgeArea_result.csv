Set Theory,Basic Measures,foundational concepts,"Introduce set theory at an abstract level and make sure that students learn to think abstractly and solve abstract problems before moving on to considering applications.

Set Theory,Basic Measures,foundational concepts,"Introduce a simple mapping construct and let them see where set theory lies behind the scenes, as in the example of the flu maps.  Engage them and get them to tell you where they see it.  Start out by suggesting a few ideas until they spontaneously enter the conversation with ideas of their own.  Then introduce several more until they get to be good at identifying set theory concepts that underlie existing spatial representations of the Earth, such as maps."

They might consider an organizational hierarchy, such as a Hasse Diagram (perhaps in simplified form) or a Venn Diagram, for putting their materials together.

Aerial Photography,Digital Data Sources & Capture Methods,data capture,"The image below shows downtown Oneonta, New York. The vertical aerial photograph was taken in 1937 and was used to create the 1942 USGS topography map. The green arrow on the photograph is pointing to the childhood home of Sherman Mills Fairchild, one of the pioneers in the field of aerial photography and photogrammetry. This exercise is to determine the scale of the photograph. The map scale is 1:24000, a representative fractional (RF). The RF describes the ratio between the map and the Earth’s surface. For example, 1 inch on the map equals 24,000 inches on the land surface. The red dot on the photo is the principal point. It is best to determine the scale by taking measurements in the middle of the photo where the least amount of distortion exists. The yellow line on the map is .5 inches and the corresponding line on the photo is .75 inches; thus, the lines appear larger than the measurements taken from the original map and photo. To calculate the photo scale first multiply the map distance (.5) by the surface scale (24000) and then divide the results by the photo distance (.75). The photo scale should be 1:16000. Calculating the scale of an aerial photograph is a basic photogrammetric technique. The photo scale is larger than the map scale, and thereby, should provide more information. Repeat this process by selecting another aerial photo and matching map."
